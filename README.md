## I made this app for fun and hobby. Nothing more...
- you can check the source code if you having doubt about my apps.
- I made this open to public. so this is my proof that my apps not having any "Sussy Baka" scripts.
- I will add some analytics for this apps to track count how many user have used my apps thats all. don't worry I will use Google Analytics so it's safe.
## In the future I may add more feature like:
- Notify you when your selected talents book is available on that day or earlier,
- can write note and save it and put some due date so it can notify you when your note is set on that day.
- Damage Calculation??.. emm I will take a note about that HAHA.
